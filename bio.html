                <p>Grace Hopper was born Grace Murray on December 9, 1906, in New York City. After graduating from
                    Hartridge High School in Plainsview, New Jersey, she applied to attend Vassar College at 16. Her
                    first attempt was denied, due to low scores in Latin, but she was admitted the following year.
                    Hopper, then Murray, graduated from Vassar with a bachelor's degree in math and physics in 1928. The
                    photo to the right is a portrait of her from around this time. She went on to earn a master's degree
                    from Yale University in 1930. 1930 is also the year that she married Vince Foster Hopper and took
                    his name. In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in math, also from Yale. In 1931, she began teaching math at
                    Vassar, and was promoted in 1941 to associate professor. In 1940, shortly after World War II
                    broke out, Hopper attempted to enlist in the U.S. Navy but was denied. At 34 years of age, she was
                    considered too old. She was finally able to enlist in the Navy Reserve in 1943.</p>

                <p>Once in the Navy Reserve, Hopper volunteered to serve with the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer
                    Emergency Service), which was the women's branch of the Reserve during the war. In December of 1943,
                    she began attending the Naval Reserve Midshipman's School in Massachusetts. She graduated in 1944 as
                    a lieutenant, junior grade and joined the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University.
                    It was shortly after this, in 1945, that Hopper divorced her husband Vince Foster Hopper. She never
                    remarried and chose to keep his name after the divorce. As part of her work for the Bureau of Ships
                    Computation Project, Hopper worked on IBM's Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, known today as
                    the Mark I. The Mark I was used late in the war to do calculations for the Manhattan Project.
